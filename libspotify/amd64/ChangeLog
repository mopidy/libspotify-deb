Version 0.0.6

	SPOTIFY_API_VERSION is bumped to 6.

	feature: Playlist folders. The folders are implemented as
	specialized playlists. Two specialized types of playlists
	can be used to push/pop depth in the a playlist container view.
	See sp_playlist_type and sp_playlistcontainer_playlist_type().

	feature: Autolinking of tracks, see sp_track_is_autolinked().

	feature: Add support for extracting playlist description and
	playlist images.

	feature: Make it possible to query if a track is a local track.
	See sp_track_is_local().

	feature: sp_session_release() is now available and thus,
	sp_session_init() has been renamed to sp_session_create()

	feature: Improved audio delivery handling.

	An application may choose to implement a callback in the session
	struct that allows libspotify to query the applcation audio buffer
	statistics.  The application should return number of samples
	currently in its buffer and also if it has experienced any audio
	dropouts (stutters) since the last query. The query
	callback (get_audio_buffer_stats) will be invoked ca 10 times per
	second.

	If an application implements the get_audio_buffer_stats() it may
	also choose to implement the start_playback() and stop_playback()
	callbacks.  The start_playback() callback will be invoked when
	there is enough samples in the buffer and the session player is in
	play mode,see sp_session_player_play()

	The stop_playback() callback will be invoked when playback is
	paused and when a track ends.

	If an application reports that it has experienced stutter it may
	put itself in paused state and wait for start_playback() to be
	invoked. This wil happen once libspotify is satisfied with the
	buffer fullness.  No stop_playback() will be invoked in this case.

	feature: Prefetching of tracks has been added. See
	sp_session_player_prefetch(). Note that prefetch only works if
	the caching is enabled.

	feature: A new session configuration variable 'tiny_settings' is
	available that, when set, tries to minimize the data store in the
	settings dir as much as possible without affecting the user
	experience too much. Set this if free disk space is precious.


Version 0.0.5

	SPOTIFY_API_VERSION is bumped to 5.

	feature: The cache size can now be explicitly configured.  See
	sp_session_set_cache_size().

	feature: Support for getting create user and time for playlist entries.
	See sp_playlist_track_creator() sp_playlist_track_create_time() and the
	track_created_changed callback.

	feature: Support for loading currently logged in user's Inbox.  See
	sp_session_inbox(), sp_playlist_track_seen() and the track_seen_changed
	playlist callback.

	feature: Three new link types SP_LINKTYPE_PROFILE,
	SP_LINKTYPE_STARRED and SP_LINKTYPE_LOCALTRACK

	feature: Support for browsing other users toplists. See
	sp_toplistbrowse_create().

	feature: Support for browsing published lists. See
	sp_session_publishedcontainer_for_user() and
	sp_session_publishedcontainer_for_user_release(), also you can
	get the user object for a playlistcontainer using
	sp_playlistcontainer_owner.

	feature: Support creating local tracks. See sp_localtrack_create().

	ABI change: sp_track_is_available() & sp_track_is_starred() now need
	sp_session to be passed as an argument.

Version 0.0.4

	SPOTIFY_API_VERSION is bumped to 4.

	feature: libspotify is now available for Win32 and OS/X platforms.

	feature: Add support for starred tracks. See sp_track_is_starred(),
	sp_track_set_starred() and sp_session_starred_create().

	feature: Add support for radio. See sp_radio_search_create().

	feature: Add support for loading playlist without adding them to
	the users's playlist container. See sp_playlist_create().

	feature: Add support for 320kb/s streaming. See
	sp_session_preferred_bitrate().

	feature: Added new session callback streaming_error() that is invoked
	if the library is unable to play the requested track.

	feature: Add new session callback userinfo_updated() that is invoked
	when one or more sp_user entries have been updated.

	ABI change: Due to internal changes, the sp_playlist_add_tracks()
	needs sp_session to be passed as an argument.

	API change: The include file has been renamed from spotify/api.h to
	libspotify/api.h for coherency reasons.

Version 0.0.3

	SPOTIFY_API_VERSION is bumped to 3.

	feature: libspotify is now available for 64-bit x86 Linux platforms

	feature: sp_artistbrowse_num_albums() and sp_artistbrowse_album()
	have been added so users of the API can list all albums returned
	in an artist browse.

	bugfix: SP_ERROR_OTHER_PERMAMENT renamed to SP_ERROR_OTHER_PERMANENT

	feature: The sp_image API has changed. libspotify now exposes the
	source image data via the API. See sp_image_data() and
	sp_image_format()

	feature: PlaylistContainer have a new callback container_loaded()
	that is invoked after the container has been initially
	synchronized from the server.

	feature: Added support for toplists. See the sp_toplistbrowse API
	functions.

	feature: Add sp_link_as_track_and_offset() for getting play start
	offset encoded in URIs.

Version 0.0.2

	SPOTIFY_API_VERSION is bumped to 2.

	feature: sp_search_create() has been extended with offset and
	limit for album and artist results.

	bugfix: libspotify contained a bug that caused it to hang if a
	playlist was removed when libspotify was running.

	feature: sp_track_is_available() has been added to allow the user
	to query if a track can be played or not due to regional
	restrictions.

	feature: sp_album_is_available() has been added to allow the user
	to query if a album is available or not due to regional
	restrictions.

	feature: playlist_metadata_updated() per-playlist callback has
	been added, allowing the user to refresh metadata for tracks in a
	playlist.

	feature: sp_album_type() has been added to allow the user to find
	out the album type. See the sp_albumtype enum for the available
	types.

	feature: An end_of_track() session callback has been added. Prior
	to this release the music_delivery() callback would be invoked
	with num_frames set to 0 both to indicate audio discontinuity (as
	a result of a seek from the main thread) and also to indicate
	end-of-track.  To ease application development, end_of_track() is
	now invoked at the end of a track and music_delivery() is only
	invoked with num_frames set to 0 as a result of a seek.
